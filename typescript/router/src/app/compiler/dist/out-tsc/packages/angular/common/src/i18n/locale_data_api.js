 * The date-time pattern shows how to combine separate patterns for date (represented by {1})

 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short

/**
 * Number format that depends on the locale.
 *
 * Numbers are formatted using patterns, like `#,###.00`. For example, the pattern `#,###.00`
 * when used to format the number 12345.678 could result in "12'345,67". That would happen if the
 * grouping separator for your language is an apostrophe, and the decimal separator is a comma.
 *
 * <b>Important:</b> The characters `.` `,` `0` `#` (and others below) are special placeholders;
 * they stand for the decimal separator, and so on, and are NOT real characters.
 * You must NOT "translate" the placeholders; for example, don't change `.` to `,` even though in
 * your language the decimal point is written with a comma. The symbols should be replaced by the
 * local equivalents, using the Number Symbols for your language.
 *
 * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:
 *
 * | Symbol | Meaning |
 * |--------|---------|
 * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |
 * | , | Replaced by the "grouping" (thousands) separator. |
 * | 0 | Replaced by a digit (or zero if there aren't enough digits). |
 * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |
 * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |
 * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | E | This marks a scientific format. The E symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | ' | Special characters used as literal characters are quoted with ASCII single quotes. |
 *
 * You can find more information
 * [on the CLDR website](http://cldr.unicode.org/translation/number-patterns)
